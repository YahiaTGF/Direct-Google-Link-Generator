# Direct-Google-Link-Generator
A Python script that automatically generates Direct Download links from a given JSON file.

To use the script, simply create a JSON file with as many links as you'd like (Formatted correctly in JSON file formatting) before opening the script, changing the second line's link to where the JSON file is (If it's in the same directory, name.json works) then you can simply run the script and it'll create a results.txt with the direct links.
